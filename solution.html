            <p>The primary CTAs above will appear on the homepage of the website and be a simple outline to reflect whatever color it is going to be against. Having the CTAs as a simple design lets the audience take action wihtout taking away from the website itself. The CTAs donate, adopt, and volunteer will stand out as a darker shade than the background while the contact CTA will be a simple outline that won't distract the audience from doing the other three actions. The donate, adopt, and volunteer CTAs will be linked to the corresponding page that has information, imagery, and links to various paperwork that are needed to do each of these things. The contact button will direct the viewer to an option to call their number or email them.</p>

            <h2>Style Tile</h2>

            <p style="text-align: left;"> A style tile enables us to create a visual tone on what the website would feel like. It is categorized between a simple mood board and a detailed website mockup. The style tile pictured is a taste the direction of how the website will be presented.</p>

            <div class="image"> 
                <span class="image fit;"> <img src="images/StyleTile2.jpg" height="800"/></span>
            </div>

                <p>My style tile conveys the feeling of warmth, friendliness, reliability, compassion, and an intiving presence. These are all the adjectives that are needed on a humane socitey's website. I chose warm imagery of happy cats and dogs, which would reflect previously adopted pets with their now forever home.</p>

           
                <p>I encorporated warm colorst that reflect warmth and coziness. These warm colors are a representation of a common color of the fur of both cats and dogs. Not only do they display the animals physical characteristics, they communicate the warmth of a sunset which is my overlying theme for the warm happiness for the website redesign.</p>

                <p>For the Logo, I created a simple type design from the Pickens County Human Society name. I made a vector from a paw that was used often on their original website. The paw icon would be used in smaller cases instead of the entire logo. I plan on tweaking the paw to make it more unique and identifiable as the Pickens County Humane Society logo.</p>
