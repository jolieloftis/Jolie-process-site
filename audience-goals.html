                                <p class="info"> After conducting research, it is important to understand who the audience is and what the goals are for the Pickens County Humane Society. </p>

                    <h2>
                        <p style="text-align: left">Audience</p>
                    </h2>
                        <p style="text-align: left;">To identify who the target audience is for the website, we wrote every possible viewer on sticky notes and organized them in a way to prioritize who the fans and possible skeptics are.</p>

                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="4u"><span class="image fit small"><img src="images/sticky.jpg" alt="audience notes"></span></div>

                            <div class="8u$"><p>First, I wrote down every identifiable singular audiences and organized them in separate sticky notes. I created four separate sections and categroized them by who needs animals for therapy reasons, who's most likely to adopt pets (or fans), who is most likely to pitch in, and the skeptics.</p></div>

                            <div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img height="700" src="images/sticky1.jpg" alt="audience notes"></span></div>

                            <div class="8u$"><p>The first section is categorized by the possible audience that needs animals for theraputic reasons. These people will visit the site in need of animal companions who are trained or can be trained as for personal service. The audience that fit into this category is the elderly, those with disabilities, and the homeless.</p></div>

                            <div class="4u"><span class="image fit small"><img height="700" src="images/sticky2.jpg" alt="audience notes"></span></div>

                            <div class="8u$"><p>The next section is categorized as fans, or the possible audience that would adopt animals from a shelter besides buying from a breeder. These people will visit the site for the purpose of adopting a family pet or personal companion. The audience that fit into this category are families with children, couples, and college students.</p></div>

                            <div class="4u"><span class="image fit small"><img height="800" src="images/sticky3.jpg" alt="audience notes"></span></div>

                            <div class="8u$"><p>This section is categorized as the possible audience that would use their resources to pitch in. This includes big corporations that are associated with animal care to donate to the facility in return of advertisement. This also would include schools where they would have classes or other volunteer related systems where students would come help at the shelter. Veternarians are also included in this audience because they could possibly volunteer to help aid animals or give supplies. Other sanctuaries or humane societies would also visit the site in search of supplies or volunteering in return for the same help.</p></div>

                            <div class="4u"><span class="image fit small"><img height="600" src="images/sticky4.jpg" alt="audience notes"></span></div>
                            <div class="8u$"><p>The last section is categorized by the possible skeptic audience that would not necesarily agree with the idea of adopting from animal shelters. This would include other animal faclities that kill their held animals over time who may not agree with taking in donations or needing as much help as the no-kill shelter. Another possible skeptic would include animal abusers. We may not know who exaclty these peopel are but they are definitly out there so covering the imporance of the issue with animal abuse need to be identifiable on the re-designed website. Another skeptic would be those who do not agree with adopting from animal shelter for the soul purpose of only purchasing pure-breeds and/or from breeders.</p></div>
